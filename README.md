# Testing APIs with JUnit 5 and REST Assured

REST Assured is a Java library for testing RESTful APIs. REST Assured simplifies the testing process by offering an easy-to-use interface for sending HTTP requests, validating responses, and performing various types of assertions.

JUnit 5 provides a standardized framework for writing and executing tests in Java. By using JUnit 5, you ensure consistency in your testing approach across different parts of your application, including API testing with REST Assured. Key features of JUnit 5 include:
1. Annotations
2. Assertions
3. Parameterized Tests

This project provides a demonstration of JUnit 5's powerful testing capabilities with REST Assured's robust API testing features for comprehensive and reliable testing of Java applications.
